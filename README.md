Welcome to my own made flowchart converter program

This program convert a given c code into a flowchart.

For executing this program, you need a c code file.

For launching it you can type in your bash command-line:

            python3 flowchart_generator.py yourCfile.c

or:
            gcc flowchart_generator.c -o flowchart_generator

and:
            ./flowchart_generator yourCfile.c

I am also actually working on a web version :D
